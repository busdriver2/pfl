          <h2>Environment</h2>
          <p> For this project, I decided to use blender as my main rendering program. All of the code I
            personally wrote was in python and the final product is a blender add-on with a UI interface that
            starts the simulation. All of the parameters can be edited within the python scripts. The add-on
            UI and basic implementation was done by a Visual Studio Code plugin called “Blender
            Development” by Jacques Lucke which can be found here:
            <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacquesLucke.blender-development">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacquesLucke.blender-development</a>
            </p>

          <p> Blender is mainly used to render the particles and apply shading as well as color. I used the
            built-in animation system to build an animation from a start time frame and end time frame. The
            code builds the animation frame-by-frame shown here:</p>

          <h2>Physics</h2>
          <p>Verlet integration was used for to simulate the physics of the particles using the equation:</p>
          <img src="./images/verelet.png" class="rounded mb-4" alt="code snippet">

          <dl>
            <dt>Gravity</dt>
            <dd>
              I simply added the gravity acceleration each step for every particle.
              This was the first force that I implemented and tested because it was the simplest.
              
            </dd><img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-03-02 154721.png" class="rounded mb-4" alt="code snippet">
            <dt>Boundaries</dt>
            <dd>For the bounding box/sphere, I applied constraints on every particle so that if it
              ever exits the boundary, its current position will be relocated to be within the boundaries. I
              decided to use a sphere for most of my simulations because it more accurately showed the effects
              of fire.
            </dd><img src="images/Screenshot 2024-03-02 154733.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="...">
            <dt>Collision</dt>
            <dd> I used a brute force method for collisions, looping over each particle in a nested loop
              to check if the distance between them was greater than the sum of their radius. If so, I pushed
              each particle back by half its radius in the same axis they collided in.</dd>
              <img src="./images/collision.png" class="rounded mb-4" alt="code snippet">
            <dt>Temperature</dt>
            <dd>Since this is a fire simulation, I added temperature as an attribute to the Particle
              class. The temperature will determine each particle’s color. This is done by creating a color ramp
              and mapping the temperature to the color. This was done through blender’s material function and I apply the material to each particle with
              its color. Everytime its temperature changes, I needed to update the color as well, so this was
              done by inserting a frame with its datapath as the color ramp change.</dd>
              <img src="./images/temperature.png" class="rounded mb-4" alt="code snippet">
            <dt>Heat transfer</dt>
            <dd> Everytime a particle came in contact with another particle, there needed to be
              thermal conduction. This was done by using the Heat transfer equation. We also needed to make
              sure that the heat transferred from the hotter particle to the cooler particle as well.</dd>
            <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-03-02 155335.png" class="rounded mb-4" alt="code snippet">
            <dt>Thermal buoyancy</dt>
            <dd>Since higher temperatures means higher energy, the particles need to
              display some kind of effect that indicates that they are in a higher energy state. This was done by
              implementing thermal buoyancy using the thermal buoyancy equation. The equation was edited a
              little bit to just simply approximate the buoyancy.</dd>
            <img src="./images/thermal_buoyancy.png" class="rounded mb-4" alt="code snippet">
            <dt>Heat source</dt>
            <dd> For the simulation to continually run, there needed to be a constant heat source that
              was heating up the particles. I decided to place a “Hot Plate” at the bottom of the bounding
              sphere, so that all particles at that location was heated to the maximum temperature.
